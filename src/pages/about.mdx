## Hello! I'm Fabian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with focus on front-end development from Hong Kong. I graduated from [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/) majored in Computer Science.

I started off teaching myself design and web development. The emergence of JavaScript frameworks propelled my skills to full stack development. I'm currently working at [SoFi HK](https://www.sofi.hk/) where we develop an easy-to-use mobile investment platform for everyone. I also like to think and share my knowledge. I'll be glad if I can help people grow. This is one of the reason why I started blogging.

Outside of work, I'm a gamer to the core. I tend to play story-based adventurous action games. GTA and God of War series are my favourites. I'm also into tactical competitive first-person shooters like Rainbow Six Siege.

Apart from games, I also like reading particularly non-fictions, especially those that focus on psychology and philosophy. I play music mainly guitar and drums. Basketball and longboarding are also what I love to do.
